# Code Review by Chris & Simon

1. `components/SinglePlanet/singelPlanet.js`: [minor] Spelling misstake on component.
2. `components/Button/buttonTwo.js`: [minor] There is no buttonOne? Could maybe have a more descriptive name or just ‚Äòbutton‚Äô.
3. `assets/images/earth.jpeg`: [minor] The image might be a tad too large (~4,5mb).
4. `general`: When visiting a planet, it would be nice with some sort of back/‚Äòreturn-to-solar-system‚Äô-button.
5. `general`: The mute function does not work after you visit a planet.
6. `general`: Planet orbits are the wrong way around. The planet farthest from the sun orbits the sun faster than the one closest to it and so on.
7. `general`: Instead of adding/using styles in JS, try to use CSS styles and toggle them with JS.
8. `GIF`: The GIF in the readme is broken :(
9. `general`: [minor] Add .DS_store to gitignore.
10. Cool idea and well executed! Good job üëçüèº
